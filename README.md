# Omnifood
This was an interesting project with a backstory. I was looking at other developers portfolios one day and stumbled upon 
this project: https://jaytintran.github.io/omni-food/.

I thought it looked very well designed and I wanted to code an exact replica and add it to my portfolio. With that I got to work designing
the website and for some reason something did not feel right. I felt as though I had seen this design before. With a quick Google search, 
I found out it was part of Jonas Schmedtmann's uDemy course on HTML and CSS. So instead of just trying to replicate it, I tweeked the 
website to make it more of my own. Different color schemes, adding transitions, different fonts, and different photos to make it more 
of my own.

Currently still working on the project. Will update once it is fully complete.
